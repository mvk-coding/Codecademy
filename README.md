# Codecademy - Learn C++

I love to expand my knowledge and thus started the "Learn C++" course by Codecademy. Part of this course are some fun little projects which I will share in this repository along the way.

The course can be found here:

## Part 1: Hello World

The start of learning any new programming language: printing out a message :)

### Block Letters:

* [initials.cpp](1_hello_world/block_letters/initials.cpp)</li>
* [christmas_tree.cpp](1_hello_world/block_letters/christmas_tree.cpp)</li>

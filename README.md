# [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) - Learn C++

I love to expand my knowledge and thus started the "Learn C++" course by Codecademy. Part of this course are some fun little projects which I will share in this repository along the way.

The course can be found here:

## Part 1: Hello World

The start of learning any new programming language: printing out a message :)

### Block Letters:

* [initials.cpp](1_hello_world/block_letters/initials.cpp)</li>
* [christmas_tree.cpp](1_hello_world/block_letters/christmas_tree.cpp)</li>

## Part 2: Variables

Using variables and some calculations.

### Dog years:

* [dog_years.cpp](2_variables/dog_years/dog_years.cpp.cpp)

*(and a bit more too, namely conditionals, to improve the program)* 
* [dog_years_extra.cpp](2_variables/dog_years/dog_years_extra.cpp)

# [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) - Learn C++

I love to expand my knowledge and thus started the "Learn C++" course by Codecademy. Part of this course are some fun little projects which I will share in this repository along the way.

The course can be found here:

- [Codecademy - Learn C++](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus)

## Part 1: Hello World

The start of learning any new programming language: printing out a message :)

### Block Letters:

* [initials.cpp](1_hello_world/block_letters/initials.cpp)
A program to show my initials
* [christmas_tree.cpp](1_hello_world/block_letters/christmas_tree.cpp)
A program to show a chistmas tree

## Part 2: Variables

Using variables and some calculations.

### Dog years:

* [dog_years.cpp](2_variables/dog_years/dog_years.cpp)
A program to calculate the age of a dog of 2 years or older
* [dog_years_extra.cpp](2_variables/dog_years/dog_years_extra.cpp)
*(improved program with conditionals)* 
A program to calculate the age of a dog of any age


### Quadratic Formula:
* [quadratic.cpp](2_variables/quadratic_formula/quadratic.cpp)
A program to solve a quadratic formula (only if there are two values for X)
* [quadratic_extra.cpp](2_variables/dog_years/quadratic_extra.cpp)
*(and again conditionals, to improve the program)*
Also usable if there is one value for X or none

### Piggy Bank:
* [currency.cpp](2_variables/piggy_bank/currency.cpp)
A little program to convert Pesos, Reais and Soles to Usd

## Part 3: Conditionals & Logic

Time to add some logic!

### Space weight:
* [space.cpp](3_conditionals_and_logic/space_weight/space.cpp)
A program to converse your earth weight to your weight on another planet

### Leap year:
* [leap_year.cpp](3_conditionals_and_logic/leap_year/leap_year.cpp)
A program to check or a year is a leap year

### Magic 8 Ball:
* [magic_8_ball.cpp](3_conditionals_and_logic/magic_8_ball/magic_8_ball.cpp)
A program to generate one of the answers of a Magic 8 Ball
